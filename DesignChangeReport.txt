Design Change Report:

The new requirment change was to allow the large numbers to have a decimal point. 
One number can have at most one decimal point. When adding / subtracting / comparing numbers, 
you need to align the numbers at the decimal point and add additional zeros at the end 
to align the part after the decimal point.

I changed my variables ('first', 'second', 'third', 'add', and 'subtract') from int to double
since we are now using decimals in my numbers. 

I also added String.format and "%8.3f" to the users input numbers so that the output shows the number
aligned by decimal point and adds any zeros for any empty spaces.
