This code is made to do multiple things. 

The first part of this code is for the user to input two numbers of their choice
and the code will output results of those numbers when theyre both added and 
subtracted from eachother.

The second part of this code is for the user to input a large number of their choice
and the code will output that same number but formatted so that theres commas between 
every third number.
